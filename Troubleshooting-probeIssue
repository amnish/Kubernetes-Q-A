If pod is restarting due to probe, it is mostly livenessProbe is failing

Type of probe:

	• livenessProbe: Check if the container is alive, if tis fails, Kubernetes fails and restart the container 
	• RedinessProbe:  Checks if container is ready to serve the traffic. If it failes, the pod is removed from service end point
	• StartupProbe:  Designed for slow-starting apps. Temporarily disable liveness and readiness probe
	
	
Common issues:
     
   1. Wrong Probe path or commnad:
       - HTTP/HTTPs: the path or port may not be responding or is misconfigure
       - TCP port may not be opne
       - command might return a non-zero exit code
	2. Insufficient initial delay:
		a. The probe start check too early before the app ready. So increase initialDelaySeconds
	3. Timeout are short:
		a. App is responding slowly and timeout is aggressive. Fix increase timeoutseconds
	4. Unstable application:
		a. Application itself is crashing or unresponsive periodically.
	5. Wrong success/failure Threshold:
		a. Kuberentes give up after too few failures, Fid failureThreshold and periodSeconds


How to diagnose:
		Kubectl describe pods
		
		Looks for erro msg like livenessProbe failed: Httpp probe failedwith status code 500
		
		Check logs:
		Kubectl logs podname --previous
		
     Check probe config

LivenessProbe:
	httpGet:
		Path: /heatlhz
		Port: 8080
	InitialDelaySeconds: 10
	timeoutSeconds: 1
	periodSeconds: 10
	failureThreshold: 3
	
	
Fix suggestion:
     -  Ensure the probe path is correct and the app serves it
	- Add the startupProbe if you app is slowing booting up or need extra time on startup
	- Increase initialDelaySeconds and timeoutSeconds
	- User proper health checks in the app(e.g /healthz returning 200 OK)
startupProbe:
   httpGet:
            path: /healtz
           port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
timeoutSeconds: 1
periodSeconds: 10
failureThreshold: 3

LivenessProbe:
     httpGet:
        path: /healthz
         port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
LivenessProbe:
     httpGet:
        path: /readyz
         port: 8080
    initialDelaySeconds: 10
